## 3.2 Are you affected ?
To check if you are infected:

Powershell : Get-WinSystemLocale<br>
if "Name" start with en-<br>
check for the rest<br>
if not then you are most likely safe


Does this exist?
```
C:\systemfile\
C:\Windows\security\pywinveraa
```

Or do these Task exist in Task Scheduler
```
Microsoft\Windows\AppID\VerifiedCert
Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Maintenance
Microsoft\Windows\Services\CertPathCheck
Microsoft\Windows\Services\CertPathw
Microsoft\Windows\Servicing\ComponentCleanup
Microsoft\Windows\Servicing\ServiceCleanup
Microsoft\Windows\Shell\ObjectTask
Microsoft\Windows\Clip\ServiceCleanup
```

Then you are affected

## 3.3 Why are only "en-" Users affected ?
There is a check in Stage 3, where the bad stuff happens, here it checks for the SystemLocale if it is not en- it kills the cmd.exe which stops everything else (look at the first Showcase linked above).<br>
On the right side you see the Processes, here if it reaches 560 cmd.exe it opens powershell with the check.
The check failes (for us germans for example) and it kills itself.
For others here the script just keeps going.
